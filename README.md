# My emacs enviroment

My emacs enviroment. Feel free to copy/clone/fork.

## What is in it?

+ [uniquify](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/uniquify), for better buffer naming.
+ [web-mode](http://web-mode.org/), great for editing django templates (HTML, javascript and django tags).
+ [yasnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet), best snippet extension ever!
+ Auto-saves and backups in the tmp directory.
+ Highlight matching brackets.
+ Spaces instead of tabs.
+ C and C++ with 4 spaces indentation (linux style).
+ Javascript with 2 spaces indentation.
+ Fixed window width: 80
+ Vertically maximize emacs on startup base on resolution.
+ Lots of useful snippets for python, django, html, jquery, etc.
+ Key binding `C-}` to double the frame width and split window horizontally.
+ Key binding `C-{` to keep current window (closes the rest) and returns to normal frame width.
+ Key binding `C-tab` to open the python shell (python-mode only)
