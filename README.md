## What is in it?

+ Spaces instead of tabs.
+ Auto-saves and backups in the tmp directory.
+ Width of window: 80
+ Vertically maximize emacs on startup base on resolution.
+ Key binding "C-}" to double the frame width and split window horizontally.
+ Key binding "C-{" to keep current window (closes the rest) and returns to normal frame width.
+ Highlight matching brackets.
+ Javascript with 2 spaces indentation.
+ [uniquify](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/uniquify), for better buffer naming.
+ C and C++ with 4 spaces indentation (linux style).
